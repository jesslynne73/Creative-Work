# Graphic-Design
I hold a NOCTI certification in Advertising & Design from a career and technical education center. Many of these projects were in support of receiving that certification or as assignments for my coursework at Penn State. I also do some marketing work as president of Days for Girls at Penn State, an on-campus organization that sews reusable menstrual health kits.
